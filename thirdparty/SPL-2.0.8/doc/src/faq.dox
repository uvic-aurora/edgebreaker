\page faq Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

The following is a list of common questions/problems encountered
when using the library.

<ul>

<li>
I would like to avoid many stressful days and sleepless nights debugging
my code that uses the SPL library.
Do you have any suggestions on how I can avoid needless mistakes?
Are there any common pitfalls that I should be particularly careful
to avoid?

Sadly, one of the most common sources of problems is not reading
the documentation and making incorrect assumptions about how the
library works.
Unfortunately, an incorrect assumption about how the library
works can be quite costly, leading to hours of unnecessary debugging time.

<li>
My code is triggering a failed assertion in the SPL library.
What does this mean?

The SPL library makes frequent use of assertions in order to assist in the
detection of bugs.
If an assertion fails, the code has encountered a situation that should
never occur in correct code.
The most likely cause is that you are using the library incorrectly.
Be sure that you have read the documentation for the parts of
the library that you are using in order to ensure that you are
using it correctly.

</ul>
