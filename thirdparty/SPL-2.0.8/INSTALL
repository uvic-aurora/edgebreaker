Installing the SPL Software
===========================

The SPL software should build on most Linux systems with a C++ compiler that
supports C++14.

Installation Steps
------------------

In what follows, $SOURCE_DIR denotes the top-level directory of the SPL
software distribution (i.e., the directory containing the INSTALL file that
you are currently reading), $BUILD_DIR denote denotes a directory (which is
either empty or to be newly created) to be used for building the software,
and $INSTALL_DIR denotes the directory under which the software should
be installed.

Note that in-source builds are not supported.  So, $BUILD_DIR must be
different from $SOURCE_DIR.

To build the software, the following steps are required (in order):

1. Install the prerequisite libraries.

Ensure that all of the libraries needed by the SPL software are installed
on your system.  This includes the following libraries:

    1) Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL)
    http://www.cgal.org

    2) OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT)
    http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/
    http://freeglut.sourceforge.net

    3) Sndfile Library
    http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile

Some platforms provide a package manager for installing software packages and
their dependencies.  For example, Fedora provides the DNF package manager,
which is accessed via the dnf command, and Ubuntu provides the Apt package
manager, which is accessed via the apt-get command.  If a package manager
is available on your system, it can likely be used to simplify the process
of installing some of the above prerequisite libraries.  For example, on a
Fedora system with the DNF package manager, some of the above libraries
could be installed by using a sequence of commands resembling the following:

    dnf install CGAL CGAL-devel CGAL-demos-source mpfr-devel
    dnf install freeglut freeglut-devel
    dnf install libsndfile libsndfile-devel

Note that the specific package names required by the package manager will
vary from one version of Fedora to another and may not exactly match those
appearing above.

2. Generate the native build files.

If the build directory $BUILD_DIR does not exist, create it by using the
command:

    mkdir -p $BUILD_DIR

Generate the build files for the native build tool on your system using
the command:

    cd $BUILD_DIR
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALL_DIR $OPTIONS $SOURCE_DIR

where $OPTIONS corresponds to zero or more -D options as described in the
later section titled "Cmake Options".

3. Build the software.

To build the software, use the command:

    cmake --build $BUILD_DIR --clean-first

4. Test the software (prior to installation).

Run some basic sanity checks on the software, prior to installation.
Although this step is not strictly required, it is strongly recommended that
this step not be skipped.  The test the software, use the command:

    cd $BUILD_DIR
    ctest --output-on-failure

Some tests may require considerable time to complete.  So, be prepared to
go for a coffee break.  After all of the tests have run, a message should
be printed that indicates how many tests passed of those that were run.
If any of the tests failed, this is an indication that something is wrong
and the SPL software is not working reliably.  If such a situation arises,
it is likely due to either an error made by the person installing the software
or a bug in the software itself.

Some of the tests may require graphics capabilities.  If the graphics
display is not on the local machine, this can sometimes cause problems.
For example, some tests may fail due to bugs in the graphics libraries that
handle remote displays.  In such cases, it may be desirable to disable tests
that require graphics capabilities.  To do this, set the environment variable
SPL_MAKE_CHECK_ENABLE_GRAPHICS to 0 (before running ctest).

5. Install the software.

The actual installation of the software may require special administrator
privileges depending on the target directory for installation (i.e.,
$INSTALL_DIR).  To install the executables, libraries, include files, and
other auxiliary data, use the command:

    cmake --build $BUILD_DIR --target install

Cmake Options
-------------

The option OPTION can be set to the value VALUE with a command-line option
of the form -DOPTION=VALUE
The following options are supported:

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
    Specify the installation directory.
        Value: A directory name.

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
    Specify the build type (i.e., release or debug).
    Valid values: Debug or Release

SPL_ENABLE_ASAN
        Enable the Address Sanitizer.
        Valid values: true or false

SPL_ENABLE_USAN
        Enable the Undefined-Behavior Sanitizer.
        Valid values: true or false

SPL_ENABLE_LSAN
        Enable the Leak Sanitizer.
        Valid values: true or false

SPL_ENABLE_MSAN
        Enable the Memory Sanitizer.
        Valid values: true or false
